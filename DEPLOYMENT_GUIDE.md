# Vercel Deployment Guide - Student Analytics Dashboard

## Fixed Issues

The deployment issue where only "student-analytics-dashboard" text was showing has been resolved. Here are the fixes applied:

### 1. Updated API Service Configuration
- Modified `src/services/api.js` to use the same domain in production
- Added fallback mechanism for API unavailability
- Prevents blocking during initial load

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration
- Simplified `vercel.json` for better routing
- Proper static asset handling
- Hybrid deployment (frontend + API)

### 3. Added Missing Pages
- Created `src/pages/google-sheets-data/index.jsx`
- Created `src/pages/test-connection/index.jsx`
- Prevents routing errors

### 4. Improved Build Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.mjs` with proper base path
- Enhanced build settings for production

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Vercel Project Settings
```
Framework Preset: Vite
Root Directory: . (leave empty)
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm ci
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Vercel Dashboard)
```
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ShivaRagula:Shiva_power_29%40@cluster0.6igmpow.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
VITE_GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=1TggXSG9WbKut8PSD8f6_c3KNtFyFt49CSpnwIis_pBA
VITE_ENROLLMENT_CSV_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TggXSG9WbKut8PSD8f6_c3KNtFyFt49CSpnwIis_pBA/export?format=csv&gid=542375196
```

### 3. Deploy Process
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set the environment variables above
3. Deploy - the build should now work correctly
4. The dashboard will load with the proper UI

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Issues):
- Only plain text "student-analytics-dashboard" showing
- API trying to connect to localhost in production
- Missing route components causing errors
- Incorrect Vercel routing configuration

### After (Fixed):
- Full React dashboard loads correctly
- API uses same domain in production
- All routes work properly
- Proper static asset serving
- Fallback data when API is unavailable

## Testing the Deployment

After deployment, you can test:
1. Main dashboard at `/` (Enrollment Overview)
2. Revenue Intelligence at `/revenue-intelligence`
3. Renewal Analytics at `/renewal-analytics`
4. Connection test at `/test-connection`
5. Google Sheets data at `/google-sheets-data`

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Visit `/test-connection` to check API status
3. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
4. Check Vercel function logs for API errors

The dashboard now includes fallback data, so it will display content even if the backend API is temporarily unavailable.
